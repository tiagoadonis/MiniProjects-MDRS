# MiniProjects-MDRS

This repository contains the projects developed for the Modeling and Performance of Networks and Services subject from Computers and Telematics Engineering course at the University of Aveiro.

## [mini-project1](https://github.com/tiagoadonis/MiniProjects-MDRS/tree/main/mini-project1)

The first project contains some exercises about performance evaluation of point-to-point links supporting packet services.
All tasks were implemented using MATLAB to obtain the requested numerical results.
At the end an report was written about some tasks' conclusions. You can see the report [here](https://github.com/tiagoadonis/MiniProjects-MDRS/blob/main/mini-project1/report.pdf).

## [mini-project2](https://github.com/tiagoadonis/MiniProjects-MDRS/tree/main/mini-project2)

The second project contains some exercises about traffic engineering of telecommunication networks.
All tasks were implemented using MATLAB to obtain the requested numerical results.
At the end an report was written about some tasks' conclusions. You can see the report [here](https://github.com/tiagoadonis/MiniProjects-MDRS/blob/main/mini-project2/report.pdf).
